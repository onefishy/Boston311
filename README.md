<b>I. Code Directory</b>
  1. <i>Reading in Data.ipynb</i>: reads the 311 data into a pandas data frame. Supports basic exploration of the entire set of 311 data.
  2. <i>Basic Analysis of Data.ipynb</i>: provides rudimentary visualization and analysis of closed requests generated in the year of 2015. Contrast and comparison between requests originating from call data and Citizens Connect App data is emphasized throughout.
  3. <i>Simulated Annealing.ipynb</i>: provides maximum likelihood estimations of the mixture model pa- rameters through simulated annealing. Includes convergence analysis and visualizations of hard clusterings of the data based on mixture parameter estimates. Contrast and comparison between requests originating from call data and Citizens Connect App data is emphasized throughout.
  4. <i>EM for MLE and MAP.ipynb</i>: provides maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates of the mixture model parameters through expectation maximization. Includes:
    1. performance testing on synthetic data
    2. model selection for the number of mixture components using Bayesian information criterion
    3. convergence analysis on real data
    3. hard clustering of the data based on MAP mixture parameter estimates
    4. cluster profile analysis
  
  Contrast and comparison between requests originating from call data and Citizens Connect App data is emphasized throughout.
  5. <i>Gibbs Sampler for GMM.ipynb</i>: provides Gibbs sampling from the posterior distribution of the mix- ture model. Including:
    1. convergence analysis
    2. hard clustering of the data based on posterior mean estimates of the mixture parameters
    3. visualization of the posterior predictive
  
  Contrast and comparison between requests originating from call data and Citizens Connect App data is emphasized throughout.
